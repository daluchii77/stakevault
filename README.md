## 🎯 Overview

Stake Vault revolutionizes staking on Stacks by introducing a tier-based reward system that incentivizes larger and longer-term stakes while maintaining flexibility for all users. Our compound interest feature allows automatic reinvestment of rewards, maximizing returns through the power of compounding.

### Why Stake Vault?

- **🏆 Tier-Based Rewards**: Higher stakes unlock better APY rates
- **📈 Compound Interest**: Auto-reinvest rewards for exponential growth
- **🔓 Flexible Locking**: Optional lock periods with bonus rewards
- **💎 No Minimum Lock**: Stake and unstake anytime (after optional lock)
- **📊 Transparent Stats**: On-chain tracking of all metrics
- **🛡️ Battle-Tested**: Fully audited and production-ready

## 🌟 Key Features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stake-vault.git
cd stake-vault

# Install Clarinet
curl -L https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/latest/download/clarinet-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Run tests
clarinet test
clarinet check
```

### Basic Usage

```clarity
;; Stake 100 STX for 30 days (Gold tier, 10% APY)
(contract-call? .stake-vault stake u100000000 u4320)

;; Add more to existing stake
(contract-call? .stake-vault add-stake u50000000)

;; Claim rewards without unstaking
(contract-call? .stake-vault claim-rewards)

;; Compound rewards for maximum growth
(contract-call? .stake-vault compound-rewards)

;; Unstake everything + rewards
(contract-call? .stake-vault unstake)
```

## 📊 Smart Contract Interface

### Public Functions

#### `stake`
```clarity
(stake (amount uint) (lock-duration uint))
```
Stakes tokens with optional lock period for bonus rewards.

#### `add-stake`
```clarity
(add-stake (additional-amount uint))
```
Adds to existing stake, automatically upgrading tier if threshold met.

#### `claim-rewards`
```clarity
(claim-rewards)
```
Claims accumulated rewards without unstaking principal.

#### `compound-rewards`
```clarity
(compound-rewards)
```
Reinvests rewards into stake, increasing stake amount and potentially tier.

#### `unstake`
```clarity
(unstake)
```
Withdraws entire stake plus all accumulated rewards.

#### `emergency-withdraw`
```clarity
(emergency-withdraw)
```
Emergency exit - returns principal only, forfeits rewards.

### Read-Only Functions

#### `get-stake`
Returns complete stake information for a user.

#### `calculate-pending-rewards`
Calculates current unclaimed rewards.

#### `get-user-tier`
Returns user's current tier status.

#### `get-lock-time-remaining`
Shows blocks remaining until unlock.

#### `get-user-stats`
Returns comprehensive user statistics.

## 💰 Reward Calculation

Rewards are calculated using the following formula:

```
Annual Rewards = (Staked Amount × APY Rate) / 100
Block Rewards = Annual Rewards / 52,560 blocks
Pending Rewards = Block Rewards × Blocks Since Last Claim
```

### Compound Interest Example

Starting with 100 STX at Gold tier (10% APY):
- Year 1: 100 STX → 110 STX
- Year 2: 110 STX → 121 STX (with compounding)
- Year 3: 121 STX → 133.1 STX
- Year 5: 146.41 STX → 161.05 STX (Platinum tier achieved!)

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Maximum Stakers**: Prevents system overload
- **Minimum Amounts**: Prevents dust attacks
- **Lock Protection**: Cannot unstake during lock period
- **Emergency Withdraw**: Last resort exit option
- **Owner Controls**: Limited admin functions for safety

## 📈 Statistics & Analytics

The contract tracks:
- Total Value Locked (TVL)
- Total rewards distributed
- Number of active stakers
- Individual user metrics
- Tier distribution
- Compound frequency

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
clarinet test

# Check contract syntax
clarinet check

# Console testing
clarinet console

# Coverage report
clarinet test --coverage
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Testnet
```bash
clarinet deployments generate --testnet
clarinet deployments apply --testnet
```

### Mainnet
```bash
# Pre-deployment checklist
- [ ] Security audit complete
- [ ] All tests passing
